# Rock-vs-Mines
Rock vs Mines is a machine learning project that uses a logistic regression model to identify whether an object is a rock or mine based on given parameters

## Rock vs Mine.ipynb 
This is the jupyter notebook file that contains the code that makes predictions based on the given data

## sonar data.csv
This csv file contains the data required to make predictions
The data consists of 60 parameters to make predictions and one colomn that tells whether the object is a rock(R) or a mine(M)

### Takeaway
Working on this project I learned about Logistic regression and one of it's applications.
